# Paseto Authentication

This README provides a guide on implementing Paseto as part of your 150 days of backend mastery journey.

## What is Paseto?

Paseto (Platform-Agnostic Security Tokens) is a secure and easy-to-use token format that can be used for authentication and authorization in web applications. It aims to be a more secure alternative to JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) by avoiding common vulnerabilities and providing a simpler API.

## Getting Started

To start using Paseto for authentication in your backend application, follow these steps:

1. Install the necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install paseto
   ```

2. Generate a secret key for signing and verifying Paseto tokens. Make sure to keep this key secure and never expose it publicly.

3. Implement the authentication logic in your backend application. This typically involves the following steps:

   - Receiving the user's credentials (e.g., username and password) from the client.
   - Verifying the credentials against your user database or any other authentication mechanism.
   - If the credentials are valid, generate a Paseto token using the secret key and include any necessary claims (e.g., user ID, roles, expiration time).
   - Send the generated token back to the client.

4. On subsequent requests from the client, validate the Paseto token to ensure the authenticity and integrity of the request. This involves the following steps:
   - Receive the Paseto token from the client.
   - Verify the token using the secret key.
   - If the token is valid, extract the necessary claims and perform any required authorization checks.
